Boards View work items as cards and update their status through drag-and-drop, similar to physical sticky notes on a whiteboard. Use this feature to implement Kanban practices and visualize work flow for a team. Backlogs View, plan, order, and organize work items, including using a product backlog to represent your project plan and a portfolio backlog to group work under features and epics. Sprints Access your team’s filtered view of work items based on a specific sprint or iteration path. Assign work to a sprint using drag-and-drop from the backlog. Interact with a backlog list or card-based Taskboard to implement Scrum practices. Queries Generate custom work item lists and perform various tasks, such as triage work, make bulk updates, and view relationships between work items. Queries also allow for creating status and trend charts that can be added to dashboards. Delivery Plans Management teams can view deliverables and track dependencies across multiple teams in a calendar view. Delivery plans support tasks such as viewing up to 15 team backlogs, custom portfolio backlogs and epics, and work that spans several iterations. Users can add backlog items to a plan, view rollup progress of features and epics, and dependencies between work items. Analytics Views Create highly sophisticated Power BI reports, based on Azure Boards data (work items). Access default Analytics views or create a custom view. ",

The team decides what items from the product backlog will be worked on during the sprint. The team defines the sprint goal and creates the sprint backlog (work items committed for the sprint). Sprint (Typically 2–4 weeks)\nThe development team works on the tasks defined in the sprint backlog. Daily work involves coding, testing, and collaborating to complete the user stories. The team conducts Daily Standups (Scrum Meetings): These are short (15-minute) daily meetings to discuss: What was done yesterday? What will be done today? Any blockers or impediments? Sprint Review\nAt the end of the sprint, the team presents the completed work to the Product Owner and other stakeholders. The team demonstrates the new features, improvements, and functionalities developed during the sprint. The Product Owner reviews the work and determines whether it meets the Definition of Done and accepts or rejects it. Sprint Retrospective\nAfter the sprint review, the team holds a retrospective meeting to reflect on the sprint. The purpose is to discuss: What went well during the sprint? What could be improved? What action items can be implemented for the next sprint? Backlog Refinement (Grooming)\nDuring the sprint (or between sprints), the team meets to refine the product backlog. The team and Product Owner collaborate to break down large user stories, clarify requirements, and reprioritize items as necessary. The team estimates the effort required for upcoming work.

    "content": "Every month, Google gets thousands of searches asking how ADO testing works. One reason may be that most teams use proprietary, in-house solutions that are built for testing that are separate from ADO Test Plans.\nBefore learning how ADO Test Plans works, it’s worth knowing the relevant terminology. Azure Test Plans gives you three main types of test management artifacts:\nTest Plan: It is a container made of configurations, test suites, and test cases which you can divide into shared test steps and use parameters. You can group test suites and individual test cases together. Test plans include static test suites, requirement-based suites, and query-based suites.\nTest Suite: It is a group of test cases that investigate distinct scenarios under an overarching test plan. Grouping cases makes it easier to see which scenarios are complete.\nTest Case: It is a step or series of steps to validate individual parts of your code or app deployment. Using a test case, you can check if your code works correctly and meets business and customer needs. You can create test cases under a test plan without needing to create a test suite.\nSometimes the terminology can be confusing, as many teams say “test plan” when they mean “test suite.”\nIf your team creates a Test Suite, they must choose between three different kinds of test suites, as shown below:\nTest Suite 1: Requirements-based test suites are the simplest and most traceable. They pull in all of the Test Cases for a given Requirement.\nTest Suite 2: Query-based test suites pull in a group of tests from your project, irrespective of what requirements the test cases are linked to.\nTest Suite 3: Static-based test suites are used either as containers to group other test suites or to group a specific set of test cases.\nDepending on which Test Suite you create, building a Test Suite allows you to pull in all the Test Cases that you want to test. Once you create your Test Suite with their respective Test Cases, you can execute the entire Suite, which is known as a Test Run. Before beginning your Test Run, you must choose between three different kinds of Test Suites to execute: Requirements-based, Query-based, and Static.\n",

    "content": "Before starting your Test Run, you must choose between three different kinds of Test Suites to execute: Requirements-based, Query-based, and Static. Remember: Test Suites (of any type) can only include Test Cases.\nRequirements-based Test Suite\nA Requirements-based Test Suite is one in which you associate your Test Cases to a requirement to define its acceptance criteria. Creating a Requirements-based Test Suite will pull in all of the Test Cases for that requirement. When building a suite, you automatically import all its associated Test Cases. You will instead simply choose the Requirement. You can then run all the Tests for that given requirement and see from each Test Run and conclude if the product you’re developing fully meets that requirement. As creating a suite automatically pulls in all the associated tests, your QA team doesn’t need to redo the work of populating all requirements. If your BAs and developers added the Test Cases for a requirement when they created it, the QAs can use it. This is the benefit of a single source of truth model. Your teams can benefit from each other’s work. Query-based Test Suite\nWhen you make a Work Item query and select which test cases to include into your suite, you create a Query-based Suite. Azure DevOps automatically adds all test cases that meet these criteria to the suite. When do you use a Query-based Test Suite? In some cases, teams run tests on all the Test Cases that are currently in each iteration or run tests on everything with a given tag, or some other criteria. These conditions are not necessarily tied directly to a given requirement, and you can only satisfy them through a specific query. Static Test Suite\nStatic suites are logical containers where you can add any tests you like. They aren’t connected to any requirements or queries. They are useful when you may need to create multiple levels of nested Test Suites or when you need a place to create and experiment with ad-hoc tests. ",

    "content": " Layer 7 Load Balancing\nUnlike the Azure Load Balancer, which works at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), Application Gateway works at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS), allowing routing decisions based on URL paths, host headers, HTTP methods, and other content-based criteria. URL-based Routing\nApplication Gateway can route traffic based on the URL path, enabling you to route different types of traffic to different backend pools. For example: /images can route to one pool of servers. /api can route to another pool. Host-based Routing\nTraffic can be routed based on the domain name (host) in the request. This is useful for multi-tenant applications or handling traffic for multiple websites hosted behind the same gateway. SSL/TLS Termination\nApplication Gateway can handle SSL/TLS termination (decryption of secure traffic). This offloads the decryption process from backend servers, improving their performance. Web Application Firewall (WAF)\nApplication Gateway integrates with Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF), providing centralized protection against common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. WAF can be configured with custom rules for enhanced security. Autoscaling\nAzure Application Gateway supports autoscaling, which adjusts the number of gateway instances based on the incoming traffic, ensuring that you always have the right amount of resources to handle the load. Session Affinity (Cookie-based routing)\nApplication Gateway can route requests from a particular user to the same backend server using session affinity (based on a cookie). This ensures that requests from the same user are consistently handled by the same backend for stateful applications. Multi-site Hosting\nSupports hosting multiple websites on the same Application Gateway, routing traffic based on different URL paths or host headers. Custom Health Probes\nCustom health probes are available to monitor the health of backend servers or services. The gateway will only route traffic to healthy resources, ensuring availability. Redirection\nAzure Application Gateway allows you to redirect traffic from one URL to another. For example, you can configure it to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. ",

This includes managing Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager and leveraging tools like Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) for multi-cluster environments. User Management and Access Control\nImplement role-based access control (RBAC) policies, manage users and permissions, and integrate authentication providers like LDAP or Active Directory. Storage Management\nConfigure persistent storage using OpenShift Container Storage (OCS) or other storage providers. Manage storage classes, Persistent Volumes (PVs), and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to ensure reliable data storage for applications. Networking and Ingress Configuration\nManage networking policies, routes, ingress controllers, and network security configurations. Tasks include setting up cluster networking (SDN or OpenShift SDN), load balancing, and managing multi-cluster networking with RHACM. Monitoring and Logging\nUse Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and EFK/ELK stacks (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) for centralized logging. Set up alerting for resource utilization, network traffic, and error logs to proactively manage cluster health. Security Compliance and Vulnerability Management\nApply security patches, manage OpenShift’s integrated security features, and scan images for vulnerabilities. Enable features like the OpenShift Compliance Operator for automated security checks. Resource Optimization and Quota Management\nMonitor and optimize resource usage (CPU, memory), and set quotas and limits for namespaces and projects to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure fair resource allocation. Backup and Disaster Recovery\nImplement backup and restore strategies using tools like Velero for Kubernetes backups, Kasten, or Red Hat-supported backup solutions. DR planning includes setting up automated backups and validating restore procedures regularly. Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM)\nInstall, upgrade, and manage Operators for automating infrastructure components and applications. Ensure Operators are kept up-to-date and compatible with the OpenShift environment. Support and Troubleshooting\nRegularly troubleshoot performance issues, manage logs, resolve configuration errors, and work with Red Hat Support or internal resources for escalations. Common issues include network latency, failed deployments, or resource constraints impacting applications. These tasks keep an OpenShift 4 environment secure, high-performing, and aligned with organizational requirements, especially for production-grade clusters.\n",
