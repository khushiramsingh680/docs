The team decides what items from the product backlog will be worked on during the sprint. The team defines the sprint goal and creates the sprint backlog (work items committed for the sprint). Sprint (Typically 2–4 weeks)\nThe development team works on the tasks defined in the sprint backlog. Daily work involves coding, testing, and collaborating to complete the user stories. The team conducts Daily Standups (Scrum Meetings): These are short (15-minute) daily meetings to discuss: What was done yesterday? What will be done today? Any blockers or impediments? Sprint Review\nAt the end of the sprint, the team presents the completed work to the Product Owner and other stakeholders. The team demonstrates the new features, improvements, and functionalities developed during the sprint. The Product Owner reviews the work and determines whether it meets the Definition of Done and accepts or rejects it. Sprint Retrospective\nAfter the sprint review, the team holds a retrospective meeting to reflect on the sprint. The purpose is to discuss: What went well during the sprint? What could be improved? What action items can be implemented for the next sprint? Backlog Refinement (Grooming)\nDuring the sprint (or between sprints), the team meets to refine the product backlog. The team and Product Owner collaborate to break down large user stories, clarify requirements, and reprioritize items as necessary. The team estimates the effort required for upcoming work.
